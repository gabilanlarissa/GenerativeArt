Flower study using Python and Processing.

Two files are available:
	• a black&white project;
	• a colourful project with additional mouse inputs. Each time the cursor is clicked, a new colour will be printed.

You can find a couple of pieces I created myself using the code I learned from my first class.

I appreciate your support! ♥
